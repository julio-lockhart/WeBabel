# WeBabel

This is a web-based chat application developed using an SDK called [ChatKit](https://pusher.com/chatkit). This SDK provides an API that helps
easily build chat features such as:

- Group chat
- One-to-one chat
- Private chat
- Typing indicators
- "Who's online" presence
- Historical messages

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) was used for user account creation and user authentication. The Firebase user UID is used to create a user on ChatKit.
